Solvers should provide the following interface:

- SOLVE, for solving the problem.

For solvers to work it should implement the following supporting generic functions:

- PICK-VARIABLE, which returns the variable on which to branch
- PROPAGATE, does the constraint propagation on a set of variables.
- PROPAGATE-AND-SOLVE, which will do propagation, recursively solves the sub problems
  and return if appropriate a solved problem."))

In abstract, a problem consists of a set of variables with domains
and a set of constraints.

The following interface is provided to the solver:

- SOLVED-P, indicates if the problem is solved.
- SPLIT-PROBLEM, splits a problem in two on a variable.
- PROPAGATE, propagate the domain reduction of a variable.

Subclasses should implement at least:

- COPY-PROBLEM, makes an independent copy of the problem.
- SPLIT-DOMAIN, takes two prorblems and adjust the domains, used in SPLIT-PROBLEM"))
